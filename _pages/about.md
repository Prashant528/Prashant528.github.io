Hi there,

I am Prashant. 

I am a passionate and skilled **Data and Software Engineer** with over two years of experience in designing, implementing, and validating enterprise data platforms and Business Intelligence solutions in the retail sector. My keen interest in statistics, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization drives my passion for leveraging data insights to solve complex problems.

Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University, I am still honing my expertise in data-driven decision-making, software engineering and innovation.

During my professional journey, I have developed comprehensive ETL pipelines for renowned multinational retail stores such as Genesco, Wiggle, Groupe Dynamite, and Blue Mercury. My technical proficiency extends to Python, SQL, TensorFlow, and Apache Airflow, among other tools and languages. I am adept at creating custom SQL queries for business reports and visualizations, deploying batch scripts on Google Cloud Platform, and ensuring data integrity throughout the ETL process.

In addition to my technical skills, I believe I have demonstrated strong leadership and communication abilities through my roles such as Graduate Teaching Assistant, co-founder of a startup, and organizer of various events. In my leisure time, I like singing, playing guitar, writing songs or just lie down reading something.

I am always open for opportunities to contribute to innovative projects and collaborate with cross-functional teams to empower businesses and drive positive impact. Explore my portfolio to learn more about my work and let me know if we can collaborate on any ideas.
